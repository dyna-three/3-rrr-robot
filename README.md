# 3 RRR Robot
## This Repository Contains all the Codes For the 3RRR Robot Project
This Project is a WIP as our 7th Semester Project as a requirement for the Degree of Bachelors of Technology in Robotics and Automation.

## The Codes are written in MATLAB


### Features of the Project
- üßë‚Äçüíª Simplistic Codes
- ‚ìÇÔ∏è Will work in any version of MATLAB
- üÖ∞Ô∏è The Codes will be implemented in the hardware via Arduino
- ü§ñ The Robot's Function will be fully Explained in the Final Report
